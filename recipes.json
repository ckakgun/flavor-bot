Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.",

      "Check on the pan occasionally to stir it and make sure the sauce doesn\u2019t catch on the bottom of the pan or isn\u2019t drying out. If it is, add a couple of tablespoons of water and make sure that the heat really is low enough. After simmering gently, the saucy mince mixture should look thick, moist and juicy.",
      "Drain and rinse a 410g can of red kidney beans in a sieve and stir them into the chilli pot. Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another 10 minutes, adding a little more water if it looks too dry.",

      "Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to the boil, then add the cavolo nero. Cook for 1-2 mins until the kale turns bright green and softens. Lift out with tongs into a colander, keeping the cooking water to boil the pasta. Run cold water over the kale, squeeze out any excess water, then transfer to a food processor. Add the oil, garlic, lemon juice and 1 tsp salt, then blitz to a fine pesto. Season to taste and transfer to a small pan. Gently warm over a medium-low heat.",
      "Clean the food processor. For the goat\u2019s cheese paste, tip in the nuts, sage, goat\u2019s cheese, a good squeeze of lemon juice and the oil, then blitz to a paste. Season, then warm in another small pan over a medium-low heat, stirring occasionally.",
      "Bring the pan of cavolo water to the boil again, adding more water if needed. Add the pasta sheets and simmer following pack instructions. Drain, keeping back a cup of the pasta water to add to the sauce (about 400ml). Cut the pasta sheets in half and toss in a little olive oil.",
      "Stir the reserved pasta water through the cavolo sauce and keep on a low heat. If the sauce looks thick, thin down with a little more water, or increase the heat a little if too thin; it should be pourable like double cream. Spoon a pool of sauce onto each plate. Layer the lasagne sheets on top with spoonfuls of the goat\u2019s cheese paste in-between each layer. Top with the last sheet of pasta and ladle over a little more sauce, then scatter over the cheese. Recipe adapted from Home Cook by Thomasina Miers (\u00a325, Guardian Books)"

Stir in the chutney, mashed potato and coriander, add a little seasoning and chill in the fridge for 15 mins.",
      "Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. To make the samosas, lay one filo sheet on a clean work surface. Brush the filo with a thin layer of oil, then fold in half lengthways with the short edge towards you. Keep the remaining pastry covered with a damp cloth so it doesn\u2019t dry out. Spoon a sixth of the cooled filling at one end of the strip, and leave a 2cm border. Take the right corner and fold diagonally to the left, enclosing the filling and forming a triangle. Fold again along the upper crease of the triangle. Keep folding in this way until you reach the end of the strip. Place on a baking tray lined with baking parchment. Repeat the process until all of the mix is used up.",
      "Brush all the samosas with oil, then dust with icing sugar, curry powder and the onion seeds. Bake in the oven for 20 mins until deep golden brown, then serve with the flavoured yogurt and some chutney."

      "Add a 400g can of chopped tomatoes. Tip in \u00bd tsp dried marjoram, 1 tsp sugar and add a good shake of salt and pepper. Squirt in about 2 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e and stir the sauce well.",

      "Check on the pan occasionally to stir it and make sure the sauce doesn\u2019t catch on the bottom of the pan or isn\u2019t drying out. If it is, add a couple of tablespoons of water and make sure that the heat really is low enough. After simmering gently, the saucy mince mixture should look thick, moist and juicy.",

      "2 ham hocks, about 3kg/6lb 8oz in total",
      "4 bay leaves",
      "1 tbsp whole peppercorns",
      "400g potatoes, cut into bite-sized cubes",
      "85g butter",
      "350g shallots",
      "75g plain flour",
      "1 tbsp dried English mustard powder",
      "400ml milk",
      "2 tbsp wholegrain mustard",
      "2 tbsp clear honey",
      "small bunch parsley, chopped",
      "1 egg",
      "green vegetables, to serve (optional)",
      "gravy, to serve (optional)",
      "175g butter, frozen in foil overnight",
      "350g plain flour, plus extra for dusting",
      "1 \u00bd tbsp English mustard powder",
      "100g mature cheddar"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "For the pastry, wrap the butter in foil and place in the freezer the night before you need it. Put the ham hocks, bay leaves and peppercorns in a large pan. Cover with water and a lid, and simmer for 3 hrs or until really tender \u2013 you may need to top up the water level during cooking. (Alternatively, cook in a slow cooker for 6-8 hrs.) Leave to cool in the liquid, then chill overnight if you have time.",
      "To make the pastry, tip the flour into a big bowl with 1/2 tsp salt and the mustard powder. Hold the butter block in the foil (peeling back a little at a time as you need to) and coarsely grate straight into the bowl of flour, dipping the end of the butter into the flour every so often \u2013 this helps to stop all the butter clumping together. Grate in the cheese too. Use a cutlery knife to lightly stir together, then stir in 175-200ml cold water to bring the dough together. Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 mins.",
      "Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling water for 8 mins or until just cooked, then drain. Melt the butter in another large pan and add the shallots. Cook gently for 10-15 mins until tender and golden, shaking the pan now and then to roll them around in the butter. While they cook, drain the ham hocks, reserving the cooking liquid \u2013 the meat should be nice and tender. Shred with two forks, discarding the fat and bones.",
      "When the shallots are tender, scoop them out of the pan and add to the ham. Add the flour and mustard powder to the butter, stirring around the pan to make a paste. Cook for 1-2 mins, then splash in a little of the milk, stirring until smooth. Continue adding the milk, bit by bit, stirring well after each addition, until you have a very thick, smooth sauce. Add enough of the ham\u2019s cooking liquid to thin the sauce to a double cream consistency, about 300ml. Taste and season with pepper \u2013 it should be salty enough from the ham stock, but add a little extra if it needs it. Stir in the ham, potatoes, shallots, wholegrain mustard, honey and parsley, then leave to cool.",
      "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and place a baking sheet on the middle shelf to heat up. Remove the pastry from the fridge. Divide into 2 balls, one a little larger than the other \u2013 keep the smaller one wrapped until later. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the large ball of dough to the thickness of a \u00a31 coin. Use this to line the base of a 23cm metal pie plate or shallow cake tin. Fill with the pie filling, then brush the edges with a little beaten egg. Roll out the remaining pastry, lay over the top, then trim the excess. Crimp the sides of the pie, if you like. Brush with more egg wash and poke 2 steam holes in the top with a sharp knife. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet and bake for 45-50 mins until crisp and golden. Serve piping hot with green veg and gravy, if you like."

Reduce the oven temp to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Add the cooled onions to the cream mixture and pour into the case. Sit the fig halves on top, cut side up, sprinkle with some more thyme and bake on the middle shelf for 1 hr-1hr 10 mins until the tart is browning and has a slight wobble \u2013 the cheese middle will firm up on sitting. Cool for about 15-20 mins, then remove from tin and serve with a green salad."

Brush the remaining beaten egg over the edges of the pie dish, drape the pastry over, trim the excess and pinch around the edge to seal.

Sprinkle over the pine nuts and bake for 35-40 mins \u2013 the filling will still be quite wobbly but it will firm up as it cools. Chill for at least 3 hrs, or overnight.

Add 150ml boiling water and whizz everything together with an electric whisk until lump-free. Divide between the tins and bake for 40-45 mins, swapping round after 30 mins if they\u2019re on different shelves (the 15cm one should be done after 40 mins). To test they\u2019re cooked, push in a skewer and check it comes out clean. Cool the cakes in their tins.",

      "Melt the white chocolate in a bowl over a pan of barely simmering water. Beat together the butter and icing sugar, then beat in the white chocolate. When the cakes are cool, split each one in half. Use the icing to sandwich back together so you end up with 2 x four-layered cakes. Sit the 20cm cake on your serving plate and spread some more icing over the top. Sit the smaller cake on top of that, and completely cover with icing. Decorate with the chocolate buttons.",
      "If you want to add some flowers choose something edible, like roses. Make a posy, wrapping the stems in a little damp kitchen paper then some cling film, add a ribbon and add to the cake on the day of the wedding."

Simmer and stir for a minute or two then pour over the fish stock. Season with salt and pepper, bring to a simmer, then add the piece of potato. Bubble everything gently for 30 mins until you have a thin tomatoey soup. When that piece of potato is on the brink of collapse, fish it out and set aside to make the rouille.",
      "While the broth is simmering make the rouille by crushing the garlic, chilli and saffron with a pinch of salt in a mortar with a pestle. Mash in the cooked potato to make a sticky paste then whisk in the egg yolk and, very gradually, the olive oil until you make a mayonnaise-like sauce. Stir in the lemon juice and set aside.",
      "Once the chunky tomato broth has cooked you have two options: for a rustic bouillabaisse, simply poach your fish in it along with the mussels, if you're using (just until they open) and serve. For a refined version, remove the herb bundle and star anise. Using a handheld or table-top blender, blitz the soup until smooth. Pass the soup through a sieve into a large, clean pan and bring to a gentle simmer. Starting with the densest fish, add the chunks to the broth and cook for 1 min before adding the next type. With the fish we used, the order was: monkfish, John Dory, grey mullet, snapper. When all the fish is in, scatter over the mussels, if using, and simmer everything for about 5 mins until just cooked and the mussels have opened.",
      "Use a slotted spoon to carefully scoop the fish and mussels out onto a warmed serving platter, moisten with just a little broth and scatter over the chopped parsley. Bring everything to the table. Some people eat it as two courses, serving the broth with croutons and rouille first, then the fish spooned into the same bowl. Others simply serve it as a fish stew. Whichever way you choose the rouille is there to be stirred into the broth to thicken and give it a kick."

Season the water with a pinch of salt, then turn the heat to medium-high \u2013 the water should start to boil after a minute or so. Slowly tip the pasta into the boiling water \u2013 do this carefully, as any splashes could burn your skin.",
      "Holding the handle of the saucepan with one hand (use a cloth if it\u2019s hot), carefully stir the pasta with a long wooden spoon in the other hand \u2013 this will prevent the pasta from sticking together. Set a timer for 10 mins. Stir the pasta every minute or so, and keep checking the heat to make sure the water is gently boiling while the timer counts down.",
      "While the pasta cooks, measure 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, 1 tbsp red wine vinegar and 1 tsp dried oregano into a mixing bowl. Season with some salt and black pepper, and mix well \u2013 this will make a zingy dressing for the pasta.",
      "When the timer beeps, it\u2019s time to check if the pasta is cooked. To do this, scoop one piece of pasta out of the boiling water using the wooden spoon, tip it onto a plate and leave it to cool slightly. Taste the pasta: if it\u2019s soft, it\u2019s cooked through, but if it\u2019s still a little hard in the middle, it needs to cook for a bit longer. Set the timer for another 2 mins, then check again.",
      "Place a large colander or sieve in the sink. When the pasta is cooked, turn off the heat and, using two hands, carefully carry the saucepan over to the sink and tip the pasta into the colander to drain away the hot water. Leave to cool for a few minutes in the colander, then tip the pasta into the mixing bowl with the dressing. Mix together until the pasta is coated in the dressing.",
      "Put a chopping board on a work surface. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half by pinching each one between your thumb and index finger, and carefully slicing through the middle of the tomato with a small serrated knife. Slice the pitted olives in the same way, then tip all the tomatoes and olives into the pasta.",
      "Put the cucumber on the chopping board and cut it in half lengthways. Lay the two halves on the board cut-side down, so they don\u2019t roll around. Cut each piece in half again, so you have four long, chunky pieces. Cut across the cucumber pieces in the other direction so you end up with small cucumber triangles. Tip these into the bowl with the pasta, tomatoes and olives.",
      "Put the onion on the board and hold it securely. Cut off the pointy end, then cut the onion in half through the root end. Peel away the papery outer layers until you\u2019re left with just the shiny onion underneath. Lay each onion half on the board, cut-side down so it doesn\u2019t roll around. Holding onto the root end, carefully slice the halves into half-moon shapes, as thinly as you can. Stop when you get to the root. Tip the onions into the bowl.",

The mixture will seem quite watery at first, but the trick is to finish cooking the bucatini by simmering it in the broth \u2013 it will soak it all up and take on the earthy flavour. Keep moving the pasta in the broth using the tongs for 3 mins, or until most of the water has been absorbed. Stir in the cream, a grating of nutmeg and the parsley.

      "pack of 8 good-quality sausages",

      "4 garlic cloves, crushed",
      "small bunch fresh parsley, finely chopped",
      "3tbsp dried breadcrumbs",

      "500g spaghetti",
      "grated parmesan, to serve"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Cut through the skin of each sausage and pull them off. Put the sausage meat into a large bowl with the mince. Add half the garlic, half the parsley, the breadcrumbs and egg, and mix well. Season generously with pepper and a little salt, and mix again.",
      "Sprinkle a chopping board with flour. Scoop out level dessertspoons of the mix, dip them in the flour and roll them into balls. Heat 3 tbsp of the oil in a large frying pan or wok, then fry the meatballs in batches, browning them on all sides. Set aside on a plate. When you\u2019ve fried all the meatballs, pour away any excess fat. Rinse and dry the pan.",
      "Pour the remaining oil into the pan, heat for 1 min then add the remaining garlic and fry for a few seconds. Tip in the tomatoes and break them down with a fork or wooden spoon. Cook over a moderately high heat for 5 mins until jammy. Season with salt, pepper and a little sugar.",
      "Tip in the meatballs and turn them over in the sauce, ensuring they\u2019re all covered. Cover the pan and cook the meatballs on a low heat for about 30 mins, spoon over the sauce occasionally and add a little water if it\u2019s becoming too dry. 15 mins before the end of the cooking time, cook the spaghetti. To serve, stir most of the remaining parsley into the sauce then spoon the meatballs and sauce over the spaghetti. Scatter with last of the parsley and serve Parmesan on the side."

    ],
    "steps": [
      "Using a sharp knife, peel the onion, slice in half through the root and trim off the top. Place the onion, cut-side down, on a chopping board. With your knife parallel to the board, cut 3 slices through the onion, keeping the root intact. With knife point at root end, cut down through the onion, from top to bottom 4 times. Holding the root end, finely slice across the onion (see pic above), to give you small diced pieces.",
      "Set a large frying pan over medium heat and when hot, tip in the oil then onion. Cook for 5 mins until starting to soften, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic, cook 2 mins more until the onions start to turn golden. When the onion has softened, tip in the tomatoes and half the basil. Leave to gently bubble for 15 mins until the sauce has thickened and looks pulpy. Stir occasionally and break up any large clumps of tomato with the back of your spoon.",
      "Pour water \u00be of the way up your largest pan. Heat over a high heat and add plenty of salt. When water has reached a rolling boil, place the spaghetti into the pan. As it softens, use your hands to push all of it into the water. Give it a stir to separate the pasta, then cook according to pack instructions, about 10 mins. Taste a strand of pasta. It should be just soft, but not mushy. Scoop out a cup of water before draining in a colander (this will help to loosen your sauce).",
      "Finishing touches: Tip the drained pasta back into its cooking pan, then pour over the tomato sauce. Give everything a good stir. The sauce should just coat the pasta, if it is thick and looks dry, stir in a few spoons of the pasta water. If it is watery, cook over a low heat until evaporated, stirring often. Use your hands to break the mozzarella into chunky pieces and stir through the pasta along with the remaining basil leaves. Serve straight away."

      "350g shallot  or pearl onions, peeled",

    "steps": [
      "Heat a large casserole pan and add 1 tbsp goose fat.",
      "Season 600g large chunks of shin beef and fry until golden brown, about 3-5 mins, then turn over and fry the other side until the meat is browned all over, adding more fat if necessary. Do this in 2-3 batches, transferring the meat to a colander set over a bowl when browned.",
      "In the same pan, fry 100g sliced smoked streaky bacon, 350g peeled shallots or pearl onions, 250g chestnut mushrooms, 2 sliced garlic cloves and 1 bouquet garni until lightly browned.",
      "Mix in 1 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e and cook for a few mins, stirring the mixture. This enriches the bourguignon and makes a great base for the stew. Then return the beef and any drained juices to the pan and stir through.",
      "Pour over 750ml bottle red wine and about 100ml water so the meat bobs up from the liquid, but isn\u2019t completely covered. Bring to the boil and use a spoon to scrape the caramelised cooking juices from the bottom of the pan \u2013 this will give the stew more flavour.",
      "Heat oven to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2. Make a cartouche: tear off a square of foil slightly larger than the casserole, arrange it in the pan so it covers the top of the stew and trim away any excess foil. Cook for 3 hrs.",
      "If the sauce looks watery, remove the beef and veg with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Cook the sauce over a high heat for a few mins until the sauce has thickened a little, then return the beef and vegetables to the pan.",
      "To make the celeriac mash, peel 600g celeriac and cut into cubes. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large frying pan. Tip in the celeriac and fry for 5 mins until it turns golden. Season well with salt and pepper.",
      "Stir in 1 or 2 sprigs of rosemary and thyme, 2 bay leaves and 4 cardamom pods, then pour over 200ml water, enough to nearly cover the celeriac. Turn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer for 25-30 mins.",
      "After 25-30 mins, the celeriac should be soft and most of the water will have evaporated. Drain away any remaining water, then remove the herb sprigs, bay and cardamom pods.",
      "Lightly crush with a potato masher, then finish with a glug of olive oil and season to taste.",
      "Spoon the beef bourguignon into serving bowls and place a large spoonful of the celeriac mash on top. Garnish with one of the bay leaves, if you like."

(The carbonnade may now be left to cool and frozen for up to 1 month. Add 100ml/31\u20442 fl oz more stock to the sauce when reheating.) When the beef is ready, taste for seasoning and add more salt and pepper if you think it needs it. Scatter the chopped parsley over the top and serve straight from the casserole, with creamy mash or jacket potatoes and buttered greens or cabbage."

    "ingredients": [
      "1 medium-sized pumpkin or round squash (about 1kg)",
      "4 tbsp olive oil",
      "100g wild rice",
      "1 large fennel bulb",
      "1 Bramley apple",
      "1 lemon, zested and juiced",
      "1 tbsp fennel seeds",
      "\u00bd tsp chilli flakes",
      "2 garlic cloves, crushed",

    ],
    "steps": [
      "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Cut the top off the pumpkin or squash and use a metal spoon to scoop out the seeds. Get rid of any pithy bits but keep the seeds for another time (see our pumpkin seed recipe ideas). Put the pumpkin on a baking tray, rub with 2 tbsp of the oil inside and out, and season well. Roast in the centre of the oven for 45 mins or until tender, with the \u2018lid\u2019 on the side.",
      "Meanwhile, rinse the wild rice well and cook following pack instructions, then spread out on a baking tray to cool. Thinly slice the fennel bulb and apple, then squeeze over \u00bd the lemon juice to stop them discolouring.",
      "Heat the remaining 2 tbsp oil in a frying pan. Fry the fennel seeds and chilli flakes, then, once the seeds begin to pop, stir in \u00bd the garlic and the fennel. Cook for 5 mins until softened, then mix through the apple, pecans and lemon zest. Remove from the heat. Add the mixture to the the cooked rice, then stir in the chopped parsley and taste for seasoning.",
      "Pack the mixture into the cooked pumpkin and return to the oven for 10-15 mins until everything is piping hot. Meanwhile, whisk the remaining lemon juice with the tahini, the rest of the garlic and enough water to make a dressing. Serve the pumpkin in the middle of the table, topped with pomegranate seeds and the dressing."

      "80ml olive oil, plus extra for brushing",
      "2 tsp ground cumin",
      "\u00bd tsp ground cinnamon",
      "1 tbsp vegan red wine vinegar (we used Aspall)",
      "3 beetroots (about 400g), peeled and sliced into rounds about 0.5cm thick",

      "2 tsp smoked paprika",
      "1 tbsp semolina",
      "250g Swiss chard, leaves only (save the stalks to add to soups, stews and risottos)",
      "150g coconut oil, plus extra for the tin",
      "500g spelt flour",
      "almond milk, for brushing"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "First, make the filling. Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Mix together 1\u00bd tbsp oil with the cumin, cinnamon and vinegar, and rub the mixture all over the beetroot. Put the beetroot into a small roasting tin, season well, then cover with foil and roast for 20 mins.",
      "Meanwhile, toss the celeriac with 2\u00bd tbsp oil, the thyme, garlic and some seasoning in a second roasting tin. Separate out the slices so they cook evenly, then cover the tin in foil. In a third roasting tin, mix the sweet potato with the remaining oil, the smoked paprika and some seasoning, and cover with foil. Once the beets have cooked for 20 mins, add the celeriac and sweet potato to the oven alongside them, and roast all the veg for 40 mins further or until tender. Remove the thyme sprigs, squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins and mash them in with the celeriac, then leave all the veg to cool. All the veg can be cooked the day before and kept in the fridge.",
      "For the pastry, boil the kettle and use some coconut oil to grease a deep 20cm springform cake tin. Pour the flour into a bowl and add 1 tsp salt. Mix the coconut oil with 200ml boiling water, stir until melted (put it in the microwave if need be), then pour into the flour and mix with a wooden spoon to form a dough. Working as quickly as you can (it\u2019s best to roll the pastry when it\u2019s warm), cut off a \u00bc of the dough and set aside under a tea towel. Roll out the rest to 0.5cm thick, then use it to line the cake tin, pressing the dough into the corners and leaving any excess pastry overhanging the sides. Don\u2019t worry if the pastry breaks \u2013 it\u2019s very forgiving, so you can patch it up as you go. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.",
      "Now build the pie. Cover the base with chard leaves, then scatter over the semolina (which will absorb the beet juices), press in the beetroot, and season. Add another layer of chard, followed by the sweet potato, and season. Add a final layer of chard leaves, then top with the celeriac and season again.",
      "Roll out the pastry you set aside to a thickness of 0.5cm to use as the lid. Put the lid on top of the pie and, using a fork, press together the overhanging pastry to create a crimped edge. Make a steam hole, then brush the top with a little almond milk mixed with a spoonful of oil (this will help to colour the pastry). Bake in the centre of the oven for 45 mins until the pastry is a deep golden brown. Leave to cool for 15 mins, then remove from the tin and serve in the middle of the table. Will keep for up to three days in the fridge (the pie is also delicious cold)."

Turn the mushrooms and chips over after 10 mins.",
      "Meanwhile, squeeze as much juice as you can out of the jackfruit. The best way is to wrap it in kitchen paper, then squeeze with your hands. Trim off the feathery bits of jackfruit that look a bit like shredded meat, weigh out 75g and stir in the tamari sauce. Tip the remaining jackfruit into a bowl. Add the chickpeas, tomato pur\u00e9e and garlic and blitz together until smooth using a hand blender or use a food processor. Stir in the remaining jackfruit and shape into four burgers about the size of the mushrooms. Coat in the flour.",
      "Check the chips and mushrooms and cook for 5-10 mins longer if needed. Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil and fry two of the burgers for a few minutes each side until brown and heated through. To make the relish, put the chopped tomatoes in a bowl with the tomato pur\u00e9e, vinegar, onion and basil or coriander.",
      "To serve, sandwich two of the burgers between the mushrooms. If the mushrooms are very juicy, blot with a little kitchen paper first. Serve with half the chips, sprinkled with the paprika, and serve half the relish on the side. The remaining mushrooms, burgers and chips will keep for two days in the fridge. To serve again, warm the remaining mushrooms and burgers in a low oven, and heat the chips, uncovered, until piping hot."

      "150g dairy-free spread, plus extra for the tins",
      "300ml dairy-free milk, we used oat milk",
      "1 tbsp cider vinegar",
      "1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped",

      "200g golden caster sugar",
      "1 tsp bicarbonate of soda",

      "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line the bases of 2 x 20cm sandwich tins with baking parchment and grease with a little of the dairy-free spread.",
      "Put the dairy-free milk into a jug and add the vinegar, leave for a few minutes until it looks a little lumpy. Put half of the vanilla seeds and all the other cake ingredients into a large bowl, then pour over the milk mixture. Using electric beaters or a wooden spoon, beat everything together until smooth.",
      "Divide the mix between your two tins, then bake in the centre of the oven for 30-35 mins or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out clean. Leave them in their tins until cool enough to handle, then carefully turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.",
      "While the cakes are cooling, make the filling. To make the vegan buttercream, whisk or beat together the dairy-free spread, icing sugar and remaining vanilla seeds until pale and fluffy. Dairy-free spreads do vary, so if the spread you are using is quite soft, try to avoid using electric beaters. Stir the ingredients together instead to avoid overworking it. However, if the mixture is too firm, use electric beaters to help lighten it and add 1-2 tbsp dairy-free milk when whisking.",
      "Spread the jam onto one of the cooled sponges, top with the buttercream, then place the other sponge on top. Dust the assembled cake with a little icing sugar or caster sugar before slicing."

Leave to cool completely in the tin, trim the overhang using a serrated knife, then remove from the tin. Sprinkle with chives and more cheese, if you like. Any leftovers will keep chilled for up to two days. Reheat in a low oven before serving."

    "author": "Anna Glover",
    "rattings": 4,
    "ingredients": [
      "300g golden caster sugar",
      "100g golden syrup",
      "200g clotted cream",
      "2 tsp vanilla extract",
      "vegetable oil, for the tin"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Put the caster sugar, golden syrup, clotted cream, vanilla and a pinch of sea salt flakes in a slow cooker. Stir until well-mixed and smooth. Cook on high for 4-5 hrs, stirring every 30 mins, or until it\u2019s a golden caramel colour and looks glossy. If your slow cooker works with the lid off, cook uncovered to speed up cooking. It will take about 5 hrs if using a multi-function cooker with a locked lid that requires you to keep opening and stirring it.",
      "Oil a 20cm baking tin and line with baking parchment. Remove the bowl of the slow cooker carefully and set on a heatproof mat or chopping board. Mix with a wooden spoon or spatula vigorously for 10-15 mins to cool the fudge and to break up any large sugar crystals. The fudge will thicken as it cools and start to look matte. Tip into the tin and use a spatula to smooth the surface. Sprinkle with a little more salt and chill until set, about 1 hr. Cut into chunks. Will keep for five days in an airtight container."
